This was my first ever project, it was created at 2020 in my first year in computer engineering department.

The project was created to learn Python syntax.

The project relies on I/O files, Json files.

Everytime the project runs, it retrieves the data from the Json file and whenever changes are made in the ATM session, the project reloads the modified data to the Json file before the program shutdown.
